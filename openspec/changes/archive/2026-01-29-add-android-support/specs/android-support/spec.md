# Specification: Android Support (via Capacitor)

## 1. Requirement: Capacitor Integration
The application MUST be wrapped using Capacitor to enable Android deployment without modifying the core web codebase.

### 1.1 Dependencies
The project MUST include the following dev dependencies:
-   `@capacitor/core` (Runtime)
-   `@capacitor/cli` (Command Line Interface)
-   `@capacitor/android` (Android Platform)

### 1.2 Configuration
A `capacitor.config.ts` file MUST be present at the project root with:
-   `appId`: `com.justscales.app` (consistent with Electron config).
-   `appName`: "Just Scales".
-   `webDir`: `dist` (Vite build output).
-   `bundledWebRuntime`: false.

## 2. Requirement: Build Workflow
The build process MUST support generating Android artifacts.

### 2.1 Scripts
`package.json` MUST include:
-   `android:init`: `cap add android`
-   `android:sync`: `cap sync android` (copies `dist` to `android/app/src/main/assets/public`)
-   `android:open`: `cap open android` (launches Android Studio)

### 2.2 Asset Synchronization
The release workflow MUST include a step to:
1.  Run `npm run build` (Vite build).
2.  Run `npx cap sync` to update the native project with the latest web assets.

## 3. Requirement: Android Platform Project
The project MUST track the `native/android` directory (generated by Capacitor) in version control (excluding build artifacts like `app/build`).
*Note: We will start by generating this folder, which Capacitor expects at `android/` by default.*
